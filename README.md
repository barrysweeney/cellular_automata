# Rule 30 Elementary Cellular Automata
"Rule 30 is one of the elementary cellular automaton rules introduced by Stephen Wolfram in 1983 (Wolfram 1983, 2002). It specifies the next color in a cell, depending on its color and its immediate neighbors. Its rule outcomes are encoded in the binary representation 30=000111102." - [Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rule30.html)
